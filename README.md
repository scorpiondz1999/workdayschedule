When the planner is openned, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
When scrolled down, the user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours (from 9AM to 6PM)
When the user views the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
#dbd0aa Past
#D96A29 Present

Then the user can click into a time block and enter an event
When clicked on the save button on the right for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage
